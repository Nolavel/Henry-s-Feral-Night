# player_state.gd — autoload. The single source of truth for what the player
# currently is.
#
# Ported from ADT's core/player_state/player_state.gd, with its modes replaced
# by this game's. The load-bearing part is unchanged and deliberate:
#
#   MENU IS REACHABLE ONLY THROUGH open_menu() / close_menu().
#   set_mode(MENU) push_errors. Pause state and mode must never disagree, so
#   the two are changed together and the previous mode is remembered and
#   restored. Pause is set BEFORE the signal fires, so every listener sees a
#   consistent tree.
#
# Do not create a parallel state enum anywhere. Systems that need to know
# whether the player can act ask here.
