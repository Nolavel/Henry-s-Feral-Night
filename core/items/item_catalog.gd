# item_catalog.gd — every item in the game, resolvable by id.
#
# Loaded BY PATH, never by scanning the directory: an exported build converts
# .tres to binary behind a .remap, and a runtime DirAccess scan finds nothing.
# That is not a preference, it is the difference between working in the editor
# and working in a build.
#
# Not an autoload and not a Node — a static accessor, so anything can reach it
# without being wired to it.
#
# Ported from ADT unchanged.
