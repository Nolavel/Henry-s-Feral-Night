# =============================================================================
# equipment_slot_definition.gd — one socket, described as data.
#
# The same class describes a BODY slot (what Henry has: head, torso, legs,
# feet, pack, the fixture Kenny rides on) and a POCKET (what a garment brings
# with it). They are the same thing — a place that holds exactly one item,
# with a limit on what may go there — so they are not two classes.
#
# A socket, not a grid. Fit is one comparison against max_size; there is no
# packing, no rotation and no cell layout.
#
# Ported from ADT. Its `refuses_threatening` flag went with the Readability
# axis; the role it played here is `excluded_from_auto_stow`.
