# World architecture — what was taken from ADT, and why

Source: `Nolavel/ADT` @ `main`, read 2026-09-22. Its own `ARCHITECTURE.md` is
the best document in either project; this one records what crossed over.

---

## 1. The composition root

`world/world.gd` is now the one place systems are created and wired, and
**it does not grow as systems are added**. Three declarative lists say what
exists; the loops that build them are fixed.

```
WORLD_SYSTEM_SCRIPTS    Node classes via .new(),      parent: World
WORLD_3D_ENTITY_SCENES  .tscn via instantiate(),      parent: StreamContainer
WORLD_UI_SCENES         Control scenes,               parent: a CanvasLayer
```

Three lists rather than one, because the three categories are constructed
differently and parented differently. Adding anything is **one line**.

The island scene (`experimental_location/scenes/Graciosa_Island_Terrain.tscn`)
carries this script now; its root is `World` and it has a `StreamContainer`.
The old `GameRouter.gd` did one job — move the player onto a marker and free it
— and that job is `_place_player()` here.

## 2. `on_world_ready(context)` — the duck-typed lifecycle

Anything in those lists, plus the player, may implement:

```gdscript
func on_world_ready(context: WorldContext) -> void:
```

If the method exists it is called once, after the player, camera and every
system exist. If not, the node is skipped silently. No base class, no
registration step — `world.gd` checks `has_method()` and moves on.

`WorldContext` is a plain `RefCounted` holding `player`, `camera`,
`stream_container` and the live systems, with `get_system(SomeClass)` for the
case where a scene needs one specific system.

**This is the "almost DI" worth having.** Systems stop being hand-wired through
`@export` NodePaths in the scene, which is what every survival system here was
doing. `WeatherController` now finds the day/night clock and loads its profiles
in `on_world_ready` instead of waiting for someone to fill three exports.

The cost, and ADT states it plainly: **the dependency is invisible to static
analysis.** You cannot find it by searching for callers. That trade is
deliberate, and it is the reason this file documents it.

## 3. The save contract — converged, not reinvented

Our save system predates reading ADT and had arrived at nearly the same shape.
Where they differed, **ADT's version won**, because two codebases with the same
author should not disagree about this:

| | Before | Now |
|---|---|---|
| Key method | `save_id()` | **`get_save_key()`** |
| Partial implementation | accepted | **skipped, all-or-nothing** |
| Unknown version | passed through with a warning | **refused outright, nothing applied** |

The version rule is the important one. A half-applied save from a future build
is worse than a refused one, and ADT's note is exactly right: *a save format
without a version field is a migration problem that can never be fixed
retroactively*. Ours has carried `version` from its first commit; it now also
refuses what it cannot recognise.

`get_save_key()` over a class name exists so renaming a script never orphans a
save file.

## 4. Input — one reader, edges from events

`core/input/input_systems.gd` is an autoload and **the only file that reads
`Input` directly**. It holds no game logic: it does not decide what a press
means, it relays.

Two rules came straight from ADT's postmortems:

- **Edges come from events, levels come from polls.** A press or release is
  matched on the `InputEvent` in `_unhandled_input()`; held state and axes are
  polled in `_physics_process()`. **No `Input.is_action_just_pressed()`
  anywhere** — polling an edge from the physics frame drops presses the moment
  the idle and physics rates diverge. A query that must stay a poll is answered
  from this file's own latch.
- **One writer.** A second reader means two places decide what is pressed, and
  they will disagree on the frame it matters.

The sleep hold is relayed as three edges plus a duration. The relay never says
"that was a hold" — the one-second threshold belongs to `SleepPrompt`.

## 5. Naming, adopted

ADT's distinction, which this project does not currently follow:

- **Component** — attached to one owner entity (`StaminaComponent`)
- **Manager** — owns a collection of instances
- **System** — a single cross-cutting orchestrator

By that rule `BioMonitorManager`, `StaminaManager` and `InventoryManager` are
all **Components**: each is attached to Henry and owns no collection of
instances. `ThermalManager` is the same. Renaming them is a mechanical commit
that touches scenes as well as scripts, so it is **not** done here — it is
recorded so the next person does not add a fourth wrong name.

## 6. Autoloads

**Autoloads.** ADT holds a closed set of four and requires discussion to add a
fifth. This project had **none**; `InputSystems` is the first, and it is the
kind that earns it — a global relay with no state of its own. The same rule
applies from here: a new autoload needs an argument, not a convenience.

Note that `StreamingSystem` is deliberately **not** an autoload here, unlike
ADT's. It has one owner (the composition root) and one lifetime (the world's),
which is exactly what `WORLD_SYSTEM_SCRIPTS` is for.

## 7. Streaming — ported, and how

Done in the pass after this document was first written. ADT's is genuinely good — two rings, a cell state
machine with hysteresis, threaded loads budgeted at 2 concurrent and **1
instantiation per frame**, scanning no more than once per 50 m travelled. Ours
(`experimental_location/scripts/WorldStreamManager.gd`, 558 lines) already has
preload / activate / unload with hysteresis and an unload delay, so it is not
starting from nothing.

The gap is the one `AGENTS.md` already names: **`CHUNK_DEFINITIONS` is a
hardcoded dictionary**, one entry per chunk, exactly the "one `@onready` and one
`match` arm per chunk" the rules forbid. ADT solves this with
`WorldData`/`BlockData` resources exported from a `map_source` scene — layout is
data, not code. That is what happened here.

### The data

`core/world/resources/chunk_data.gd` and `world_data.gd` mirror ADT's
`BlockData` / `WorldData`: id, display name, location, position, radius, and the
two ring scene paths.

`data/world_data.tres` is **generated, never hand-written**:

```bash
godot --headless --script tools/world/generate_world_data.gd
```

The generator loads the island scene and reads the authored `Area3D` markers
that were already there — position from the node, radius measured from its
`CollisionPolygon3D`, display name from its `Label3D`, location from the parent.
Content scenes are matched by naming convention (`chunk_<id>.tscn`), not by a
table. Nine chunks came out with every content scene resolved and nothing
re-authored by hand.

A side benefit: the generator matches both spellings of `Chunk_`, so the
**Cyrillic homoglyph** in the authored names (`Сhunk_`, §3.10 of the commercial
assessment) is handled rather than tripped over.

### The pipeline

`core/world/streaming_system.gd` replaces `WorldStreamManager.gd`, which is
deleted rather than patched. It reads the resource and nothing else — **there is
no per-chunk variable and no per-chunk `match` arm in the file**, which is what
`AGENTS.md` asked for.

ADT's cell machine, carried over: `UNLOADED → QUEUED → LOADING → READY →
ACTIVE`, with rollback from `QUEUED`/`READY` straight back to `UNLOADED` when
the player leaves early. Budgets are ADT's too — 2 concurrent background loads,
**1 instantiation per frame**, because background loading is cheap and
`instantiate()` + `add_child()` is what costs a frame.

One deliberate difference: the load band is **per chunk**, its own authored
radius plus a margin, rather than one flat radius for everything. Our chunks
range from 190 m to 312 m across, so a single number would either thrash the
small ones or load the big ones far too late. Hysteresis is the gap between the
load and unload bands, as in ADT.

`_packed_cache` is non-optional for the same reason ADT documents:
`load_threaded_get()` consumes the task, so two chunks sharing a scene path
would false-fail without it.

**The test found a real bug here.** A chunk whose background load landed *after*
the player had walked away was still instantiated, because the pump activated
anything `READY` without re-checking distance. Both the poll and the activation
now re-check the band, and the packed scene stays cached for the next approach.
That is precisely the case ADT's rollback rule exists to prevent.

### Ring 0

Built, but empty: `silhouette_scene_path` is blank on every generated chunk
because no silhouette scenes exist yet. The island's terrain is the floor, as in
ADT after its own island move, so nothing falls through in the meantime. When
silhouettes are authored the generator picks them up by the same convention.

## 8. Two Godot traps this pass confirmed

Both were already costing debugging rounds in this project before ADT was read,
and both are the same underlying fact — **the scene tree is not ready during
`_initialize()` or before the first frame**:

- `_ready()` has not run, so anything constructed headlessly is uninitialised.
  Every system here has a public `initialize()` for that reason.
- `global_position` reads as zero and `get_tree()` returns null. The
  composition-root test now runs from the first frame rather than from
  `_initialize()`, which is also how the game actually runs.

`WeatherController._find_day_night_manager()` guards `get_tree()` for the same
reason.
